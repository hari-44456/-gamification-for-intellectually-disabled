# Gamification For Intellectually Disabled

This project works on use of gamification for intellectually disabled so that they can improve.

The user first logs in via /login url and is redirected to the games page where the user has a choice between 4 games to play.
Once any of the game is completed, the user is brought back to the dashboard where user is able to see the scores.
When a particular teacher logs in, he/she can analyse the scores of students and can also monitor the users in the system. Teacher can also create batches among the users for their own convenience.
